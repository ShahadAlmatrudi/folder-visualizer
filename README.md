# Folder Visualizer

## 📌 Overview
Folder Visualizer is a JavaFX desktop application that visually represents a file system directory using different graphical views.  
The application allows users to explore folders and files in an intuitive way while focusing on clean object-oriented design and extensibility.

This project was developed as part of a university coursework to practice Java, JavaFX, and software design principles.

## 🏗️ Design & Architecture
The project emphasizes good software engineering practices, including:

- Clear separation between:
  - File system data model
  - Visualization logic
  - User interface
- Interface-based design to define visualization behavior
- Extensible structure that allows adding new visualization types without modifying core logic

> Visualization behaviors are defined through a common interface, enabling multiple visualization implementations to coexist cleanly.
